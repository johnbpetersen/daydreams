# Scaffolding an Agent

To scaffold an agent, you can use the `createDreams` function. The following
example will create an agent with a deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b model, and the
`cli` extension. Within the extension there are predefined inputs and outputs,
these are generic enough, but you can add your own easily which we'll cover in
the next section.

<Steps>

### Create Dreams

The smallest agent you can create is:

```ts
import { createDreams, cli } from "@daydreamsai/core/v1";

const agent = createDreams({
  model: groq("deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"),
  extensions: [cli],
});
```

### Starting the agent

The agent will start processing the inputs and outputs.

```ts
await agent.start();
```

</Steps>
